All settings will be preserved.

Changes in v3.2.0.3:
> Fixed some major memory issues 
  - fixed icons being leaked.
  - Portals now virualize content out of the viewport, saving a load of memory usage.
> Fairly significant performance improvements.
  - Important Note: Icons without Thumnails (file previews on the icon itself) are now cached per file extension to save mempry and increase performance. This can be turned off in the settings if you need each file to have its icon specifically fetched (but will come with a performance hit - especially for portals with large amounts of files)
> Can now use explorer right click menu as default for folders/files.
  - Portal background right click menu being explorer is not possible yet... its more complicated.
> Explorer menu will now follow windows dark mode setting.
> Added further language options recently completed from Crowdin.
> Item margins and content margins can now be set individually for top, left, right, bottom.
> Dragging files over a shortcut to a folder will now add the files to tbe folder, instead of opening the folder in explorer.
> Icons for URL (and .website) files will fetch better.
> Implemented Single Click to Open
