MAJOR UPDATE

I have essentually overhauled the app to increase stability and performance.

> Removed bloaty material UI library
> Added Peek Function (CTRL+SHFT+SPACE to bring Portals to front)
> Added quick show/hide portals on desktop (CTRL+SHIFT+A)
> Added options to control item margin, spacing, text height etc.
> Better icon support - especially for Steam
> Added ability to Search a portal
> Added Display Name capability for Portals.
> Added support for using images as the background for Portals.
> Added ability to disable Drag/Drop
> Removed Relative Positioning (too bloaty and bearly worked) - replaced it with the ability to have layouts assigned to each of your display setups. The app will automatically detect display changes and can automatically switch between layouts.
> Added ability to switch release channel to Beta, to allow people to help with testing new versions.
> Added ability to export / import settings
> Added Full Reset capability
> Window order is now controlled by simply dragging/dropping on the main window table.
